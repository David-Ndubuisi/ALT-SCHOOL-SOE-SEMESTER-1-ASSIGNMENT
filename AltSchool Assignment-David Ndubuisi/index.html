            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is David Ndubuisi, and I'm based in Abuja. After spending two years learning web development with <a class="link" href="https://www.afrihub.com/">AFRIHUB/GDLI</a>, I'm wrapping up my studies and eager to put my skills into practice. While I can code both front-end and back-end, I have a real passion for front-end development. I enjoy the creative aspect of bringing websites to life and crafting user-friendly experiences. Outside of coding, I love gaming and watching anime series, which help me relax and unwind. I also enjoy socializing and connecting with others, both online and in person, making the most of my free time.</p>
